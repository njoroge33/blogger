                    <p>Hey, Do you love amazing content? So
                do I!</p>
            <p>I’m a passionate freelance blogger, copywriter and the founder of <a class="text-color"
                    href="{{route('home')}}">The Freelancers’ Digest</a></p>
            <p>I’m a <strong>Biochemist</strong> by profession and guess what? Just a few months ago, I was fully
                employed by a multi-national pharmaceutical company and was earning quite a competitive salary. </p>
            <p>However, something kept bagging my mind and I knew I wanted more for my life and my future.</p>
            <p>The work schedule was extremely tight and I rarely had time for my family, leave alone for myself. I also
                wanted to pursue a greater and more fulfilling purpose.</p>
            <p>One morning I just woke up and guess what? I tendered in my resignation and left!</p>
            <p>That’s how I became a <strong>full-time freelance writer</strong> (had been a part-timer for quite long
                and now I just wanted to dive all in). </p>
            <p>Now, I enjoy the freedom that comes with being a freelance writer. I’m now able to:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <li>Spend more time with my daughter</li>
                <li>Hung out with my friends more often (we go hiking a lot)</li>
                <li>Take better care of myself: physically, mentally and spiritually</li>
                <li>Make money at my own terms (working anywhere, at anytime, without demanding rules and restrictions)
                </li>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And what’s more? I now mentor upcoming freelancer writers on how to escape the RAT RACE of employment,
                set up and scale up a successful freelance writing career.</p>
            <p>I also help businesses achieve their business goals through strategic content marketing.</p>

            <p>There are several other freelance writers out there you could hire, right?</p>
            <p>Well, here are my secrets (what not every other writer will offer you).</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong> High quality content:</strong> You never have to worry about lousy, poorly-researched
                        content on your website which barely convert your readers into loyal customers.</li>
                    <li><strong> SEO-Optimized content:</strong>My articles will always be SEO-optimized with:</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thoroughly-researched focus keywords</li>
                            <li>Visual content (images and/or videos, tables, drawings, and graphical illustrations)
                            </li>
                            <li>Appropriate headline hierarchy (H1, H2 and H3s)</li>
                            <li>Meta-descriptions</li>
                            <li>Internal and external links</li>
                            <li>Alt text on images</li>
                            <li>Bullet lists for good readability</li>
                            <li>Block quotes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <li><strong> Timely deliveries:</strong>You don’t need to worry about late deliveries since I work
                        under strict timelines</li>
                    <li><strong> Value for your money:</strong>Yes, you get what you pay for, and even more.</li>
                    <li><strong> More sales and more revenue</strong>for your business as a result of more organic
                        traffic from your target audience.</li>
                    <li><strong> A growing subscribers’ list</strong> as a result of authoritative and highly valuable
                        content on your website/blog.</li>
                    <li><strong> Money-back guarantee:</strong>If you don’t feel pleased with the results (which rarely
                        happens), I return your money, 100% of it.</li>
                </ol>
